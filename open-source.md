### Licensing

Licensing an open source project is complicated.  There are many different types of licenses for different reasons, and they stipulate everything from who can use your code and for what purposes, and how much they can or cannot charge for derivative works.  

Licenses are typically concerned with:
  - Distribution
  - Money
  - Credit
  - Reuse

How to choose a license for your project

##Activity: OSS and Art + Design
1. Pair up with someone *not* from your major
2. Finish and discuss the readings:
    * [The Open Source Definition](http://opensource.org/osd)
    * [How Open Source is Disrupting Visual Art](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/how-open-source-is-disrupting-visual-art)
3. Discuss with each other how the readings and the terminology in them relates to your field or department.  Questions to consider:
    * What does "Open Source" mean in your field?
    * Is intellectual property typically freely shared, or highly guarded?
    * What are the financial implications of openness in your field's industry?
    * Is work in your field usually done alone or in teams?
    * How easy is it to find information about your design or craft in libraries, or on the Internet?
    * How easy is it to access key players in your field?
4. As pairs, present your partner's findings to the class
