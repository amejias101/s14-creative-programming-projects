##Overview

This course is a graduate-level hands-on creative-programming studio, supporting conceptual and technical research and development as students build ambitious projects of their own design. This course is ideal for students working on projects with elements involving code and needing a shared research dialogue and space within which to work, ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas. The course will consist of a combination of individual meetings, group critiques, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops. Access to a full array of languages will be supported. Workshops will focus on more refined technical strategies regarding organizing, sharing and working with large quantities of code, as well as additional topics specific to students' needs. The course will also encourage students to articulate the conceptual and material contexts of their work and to address the considerations of launching projects in social, online, hybrid and physical spaces of engagement.
