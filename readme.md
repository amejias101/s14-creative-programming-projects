##Overview

This course is a graduate-level hands-on creative-programming studio, supporting conceptual and technical research and development as students build ambitious projects of their own design. This course is ideal for students working on projects with elements involving code and needing a shared research dialogue and space within which to work, ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas. The course will consist of a combination of individual meetings, group critiques, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops. Access to a full array of languages will be supported. Workshops will focus on more refined technical strategies regarding organizing, sharing and working with large quantities of code, as well as additional topics specific to students' needs. The course will also encourage students to articulate the conceptual and material contexts of their work and to address the considerations of launching projects in social, online, hybrid and physical spaces of engagement.

##Check-ins
Check-in weeks there is no group meeting. Optionally, you can sign up for an individual skype meeting with either Evelyn or Lauren, you do not need sign up with your main advisor. There will be various time slots during the week, see the sign-up [here]().

##Expectations
This course is mostly self-directed.  As such, it will not contain many direct assignments.  When there are expected assignments to be completed, they will be assigned and clearly designated at least 1 week before.  Evaluation will primarily come from your ability to:
- organize and schedule your project
- identify obstacles and articulate them to the class
- pursue critical research in your problem space
- provide critical feedback to your peers' projects

**Mandatory**  
Every student will be required to maintain an online log, blog or website detailing their progress on their project, with **weekly** detailed updates.  This will be required to receive a final grade.

##Project Updates
Add your name and project blog link here! 

Students need to document their work online somewhere, on a site of their choice (blog, [tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [wordpress](http//wordpress.org), wiki, github, etc). A weekly update should be posted by the start of class time each week (regardless of whether thereâ€™s an in person meeting or not), including:

* Updates, milestones achieved
* Open questions, roadblocks
* Goals for next week
